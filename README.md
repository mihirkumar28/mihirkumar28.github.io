## Hi, I'm Mihir

I love to code & solve puzzles. I'm a CS grad from PICT (2017-21) & am currently working at Siemens Digital Industries Software developing cool products for modelling & simulation purposes. 

Here's a link to my latest [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nGYddI48cFtCcbA7PQplN9B1PlUcSnIO/view?usp=sharing)


In my current role, I'm a member of Mainstream Engineering R&D. I'm a full stack web developer working with internal tools as well as the MEVN stack, building low latency, highly resilient key compnents of Solid Edge to be used mainly in the Machinery, Automotive & Computer Hardware industries among others. 

I've also interned at UST Global, IBM India & NVIDIA. At UST Global, I was part of the team that built a bug severity 

In my free time, I love to cook, play FIFA and reak books(sci-fi mostly). 

I am into anime as well. MHA, DBZ, DBS, Naruto. You name it, I've probably read the manga or watched the anime :)
